Convolutions on the sphere with HEALPix pixelization

This is a PyTorch version of the NNhealpix package of https://github.com/ai4cmb/NNhealpix
which can be used to define convolutional neural networks on spherical signals on the
sphere using the HEALPix pixelization. It is based on the 
work of Krachmalnicoff & Tomasi (A&A, 2019, 628, A129).
